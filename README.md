# Interactive Belly Button Diversity Website

### Overview
The goal of this project was to produce a website that intook a JSON file of data from people of all backgrounds. Using that data, create a Javascript file that would plot the data using the Plot.ly library. The data would be logged as well as it would be able to be updated in live time based on which person is chosen from the JSON library.

### Conclusion
The app overall is powerful and could be used in a variety of ways. Knowing how to read in JSON files and making an interactive website that manipulates the data. I've also gotten much more comfortable with html as well as Javascript.
